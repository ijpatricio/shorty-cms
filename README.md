## Stackable Editor

It's open sourced ahead of time, so follow along and see the progress.

This is a build in public project (actually, build in live-streaming).

Check livestreams at: [Building a content field Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b85XfRGbDjk&list=PL2Njk5tK9lmtS-5VwsQow8o_DQmGPQkjg&pp=gAQBiAQB)

This is the Stackable Editor, a custom WYSIWYG editor, built with Laravel Livewire and Filament components.

This editor consists of blocks (in a stack). Each block is a Livewire component, therefore, it can be interactive, be easily extended, and very versatile.

Examples of blocks:
- Rich Text
- Image
- Carousel
- CodeSnippet
- Video Embed(YouTube, Vimeo)
- Video Upload (mp4)
- Audio Embed (SoundCloud, Spotify)
- PDF
- Gists

Let's see how it goes! Let me know any comments, suggestions, or questions, in this repo's issues, or in video commments.

Thank you!


PS: It's going to be first used to build a short-form content platform, which is a twist of a Blog and a Knowledge Base.

There are posts, which can be of several kinds. For example:
- A short tutorial, with a code snippet, and a brief explanation.
- A live session recap. Just in topics: what happened, and a link to the video.
- Link to a cool package, component, repository, for sharing and reference.

As usual, Posts have categories, and tags, to be listed in a variety of ways.
