## WIP WIP WIP

It's open sourced ahead of time, so follow along and see the progress.

This is a build in public project (actually, build in live streaming).

It's a platform, which is a twist of a Blog and a KB, only with short-format content.

There are posts, which can be of several kinds. For example:
- A short tutorial, with a code snippet, and a brief explanation.
- A live session recap. Just in topics: what happened, and a link to the video.
- Link to a cool package, component, repository, for sharing and reference.

As usual, Posts have categories, and tags, to be listed in a variety of ways.

We're right now (ep.9) building the WYSIWYG editor for the posts.
It's a custom editor, built with Livewire.
Each block is a component, and it's a Livewire component.

Examples of blocks:
- Rich Text
- Image
- Carousel
- CodeSnippet
- Video Embed(YouTube, Vimeo)
- Video Upload (mp4)
- Audio Embed (SoundCloud, Spotify)
- PDF
- Gists

Let's see how it goes! Let me know any comments, suggestions, or questions, in this repo's issues, or in video commments.

Thank you!
